# SQL Basics and Injection Project

This project covers the foundations of SQL, including database structure, CRUD operations, and an introduction to SQL injection techniques.

## What was done:
- Studied the history and purpose of SQL and relational databases.
- Practiced essential SQL syntax for creating, modifying, reading, and removing data.
- Explored security vulnerabilities related to SQL injections.
- Applied practical exercises using platforms like TryHackMe.

## Tools used:
- SQL Server / MySQL
- TryHackMe (for SQL Injection practice)
- Basic database management tools (phpMyAdmin, DBeaver)

## Why it matters for SOC:
- SQL is everywhere; understanding database structure is key for incident response and forensic analysis.
- Recognizing and exploiting SQL injections is crucial for vulnerability assessments and offensive security.
- Helps in detecting malicious queries and protecting sensitive data.
